These objects only reflect light, which means when light falls on these objects, it bounces off them. The light that bounces off these objects travels to our eyes and enables us to see them. ",
  "point3": "This explains why we cannot see anything, not even our fingers, in a pitch-dark room. As there is no light source in the dark room, no light will fall on the objects in the room. Hence, no light will be reflected from them and we are not able to see anything. ",
  "point4": "All objects reflect light. Animals, plants, fungi and non-living things reflect light. The amount and direction of the reflected light depend on the type of surface it strikes. Smooth and shiny surfaces reflect light better than rough and dull ones. For example, steel spoons and aluminium foil can reflect light much better than dark-coloured towels and charcoal. ",
  "point5": "The reflection of light from a smooth surface is called a regular reflection. When light falls on the smooth surface, it bounces off at matching angles which results in a reflection.",

The more offspring there are, the higher the chances of survival of their species. The life expectancy of these offspring is short as most of these offspring will die before they become adults or before they are ready to reproduce. The parents do not look after their young. The young mature rapidly and reproduce at an early age. They are thus able to reproduce so many offspring as quickly as possible.Animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring, for these types of animals it is common for a large number of offspring to die soon after birth, but there are sufficient numbers that survive to maintain the population of their species.",

Mental abilities and natural talents are also affected by heredity as is the susceptibility to acquire certain diseases. The gene is defined as the unit of inheritance.

That means one protein may only have four amino acids while another has twenty; two proteins may both have twenty amino acids but are in a different order in each protein. Each amino acid is made up of three nucleotide bases found in DNA, also known as deoxyribonucleic acid. Each DNA molecule consists of two parallel strands twisted around each other to form a double helix. A helix is a coiled structure like a corkscrew or spring. A molecule of DNA is wrapped around proteins to form a single chromatin thread. During cell division, chromatin threads coil tightly into structures called chromosomes inside the cell nucleus.",

When an individual reproduces, the two genes split up and end up in separate reproductive cells. One of these two genes is dominant over the other. The dominant allele will mask the other, called the recessive allele. For example, if the father gives a tall allele of the height gene, and the other gives a short allele, the offspring will be tall. This is because tall is dominant and short is recessive.",

In the process of reproductive cell division, by which ova and sperms are produced, the chromosomes are divided so that each mature reproductive cell contains half (23) of the original number of chromosomes, or one chromosome of each pair. Thus, when the ovum and the sperm fuse on fertilisation, the fertilised egg receives one set of chromosomes from each parent and the original number of chromosomes (46) is restored.",

    "point1": "Water is essential to all living things. Plants derive some of their nutrients from minerals in the soil. These minerals have to be dissolved in water in order to be absorbed by the plants. Water is taken into the human body by consuming plants, meat and beverages.",
    "point2": "Humans can go for a month without eating but will die in three to five days without water because our bodies are made up of about 70 per cent water. The body uses water to maintain its temperature, breathe, digest food and lubricate moving joints.",
    "point3": "A wide variety of animal life, in or around freshwater ecosystems, like aquatic birds, amphibians, mammals and a wide variety of fish depend on water for survival.",
    "point4": "Some of the most important uses of water are at our homes. It is used for indoor and outdoor purposes. All the things you do at home drinking, preparing food, bathing, washing clothes and dishes, brushing your teeth, watering the yard and garden and even washing the dog make use of water.",
    "point5": "Use of water in commercial places is important because without it, we would not have any restaurants pizza houses, coffee shops, food centres and other eateries. Along with the eateries, water is commercially supplied to motels, offices, prisons military Institutions and fish hatcheries",
    "point6": "The industries that produce metals, wood and paper products, chemicals, gasoline, oils and probably every manufactured product use water during some parts of the production process.",
    "point7": "Throughout the world, irrigation (water for agriculture or growing crops) is probably the most important use of water. Almost 60 per cent of all the world's freshwater withdrawals go towards irrigation uses. Large-scale farming will not be able to provide food for the world's large population without the irrigation of crop fields by water from rivers, lakes, reservoirs and wells. Without irrigation, crops could never grow.",
    "point8": "Water is needed to raise livestock such as cows, chickens, horses and rabbits. Here, water is needed for watering, feeding, dairy operations and other forms of  needs. This includes water for raising cows, chickens, horses, rabbits, fish and other animals. Water is also used in the production of meat, poultry eggs and milk",
    "point9": " Production of electrical power results in one of the largest uses of water worldwide. Water for thermoelectric power is used in generating electricity with steam driven turbine generators.",
    "point10": "Like other industries, mining corporations need water to make bare rocks give up valuable minerals. Water is used for the extraction of minerals that may be in the form of solids such as coal, iron, sand and gravel: liquids such as crude petroleum and gases such as natural gas. Water is needed to carry out activities such as quarrying, milling (crushing, screening, washing and flotation of mined materials, re-injecting extracted water for secondary oil recovery and other operations associated with mining activities.",
    "point11": "Hydroelectric energy is produced by the force of falling water. The capacity to produce this energy is dependent on both the available flow and the height from which the water falls. As water builds up behind a high dam, it accumulates potential energy.",
    "point12": "The gained potential energy is transformed into mechanical energy when the water rushes down the sluice and strikes the rotary blades of the turbine.",
